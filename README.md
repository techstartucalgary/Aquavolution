## Inspiration
We created the idea for Aquavolution after combining the want to spread the importance of protecting our oceans with the importance of making learning and awareness fun for everyone!. The game begins woth you as a small individual fish indide of the large and confusing ocean landscaoes, and allows you to slowly explore and see more of the world around you, growing and learning all the while, until you finally get the opportunity to try and defeat the largest predatory fish that exists.

They may not be included in the world maps you see, but Earth now has 5 major plastic islands located withins its oceans. Ocean currents cause “gyres” where the plastic accumulates indefinitely, until a whole new landscape of garbage and debris emerges. Unfortunately, one of these islands today is already the size of the United States.

<!-- ## What it does (probably not needed after inspiration?) -->
## How we built it
This game was designed an implemented by a group of 6 developers, over the course of 8 months. Meetings were held weekly, giving everyone an opportunity to work collaberatively on all aspects of the game. It is designed using the Unity game engine, with code written in C#.

## What’s next for Aquavolution
Further development of this game may include things such as expansion to multiplayer, additional map designs, and hopefully the addition of added advertisement revenue for the purposes of donating to ocean cleanup projects.
